### Introduction
- introduce the organization and the work
- explain why the work is being done and what problem will the work solve (Problem statement)
- Clearly explain aims and objectives and scope of the work (Objectives)
- Explain scope and limitations of work (Scope and Limitations)
- explain in brief about systems development, system development methodology, and alternative approaches
- explain in brief about organization of report
### Background study / Literature review
- what works have other people done (published or commercial) that is relevant to yours
### Analysis
- determine system requirement and study feasibility
- **Structured approach**
	- process modeling - DFD
	- logic modeling - Pesudocode, decision table, etc
	- conceptual modeling - ER diagram
- **Object-oriented approach**
	- use case modeling: use-case diagram
	- object modeling: clasas and object diagram
	- dynamic modeling: state diagram and sequence diagram
	- process modeling: activity diagram
### Design
- **Structured Approach**
	- design database 
		- logical - transform E-R diagram into relation, normalization
		- physical - data types, file organization
	- design forms and reports
	- design interface and dialogs
- **Object-oriented approach**
	- refine all analysis diagrams except use-case diagram adding technical details
	- additional diagrams: component diagram and deployment diagram
### Implementation
- Coding
	- design specifications turned into working computer code using suitable programming language, database technology, and interfacing technology
- Testing
	- test are performed using cvarious strategies
	- A master test plan is developed duering the analysis phase
	- unit, system and inntegration test plans are developed
### Conclusion and Future work
- conclusion after doing the work
- any future plan to extend the work
### References
- list of papers, books and other publicatios that are **explicitly** referred to in the text
- list must be sorted alphabetically ordered and numbered
### Bibliography
- resources from which the content is not used explicitly
- sources from which knowledge is taken and used in the project
### Appendices
- supplementary material
- code listings (important code snippets)
- raw data - if work involves data collection 
- test data
