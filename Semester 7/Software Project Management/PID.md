Electronic voting has been center of research and discussion for many years. The main idea is to get away from using the traditional paper method of voting and use any electronic medium.The online voting system is aimed to develop a secure voting system that utilizes blockchain to make the voting transactions secure and free from external interference. This system aims to provide a web interface with two factor authentication for secure logins and facility to vote using the internet. The usage of blockchain ensures a decentralized database system which is free from unauthorized manipulation and tampering of the votes. The usage of blockchain technology in the project also ensures transparency in the whole voting system.

### Purpose
